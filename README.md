This a bot which is good at bolt tic-tac-toe  
Bolt tic-tac-toe is a fun variation of tic-tac-toe, when a player plays the forth symbol, the first symbol disappears.  
The project include a pvp version and a vs 2p computer version.  
It's worth noting that in this game, 1p(The first player) can always win if both players play optimally.  
I will try to make the computer faster by making a map in the future :)
